# Whack-An-Alien
Alien variation of Whack-A-Mole game.

This is a game I created for my final assessment for Thinkful's web development program. It's built with HTML and JS and even tracks the score of the player. The game uses a custom song for the background and sound for onClick events when whacking aliens. The code itself features various functions and models I learned throughout this program, such as:

- math functions to update score
- onClick event listeners for custom sounds or actions
- StackOverflow helped me with getting music added to my JS files and even allowing users to control the volume manually

Hope you enjoy the game, to any who check it out!
